 Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a reliable model that can classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on medical diagnostic features, thereby supporting early detection and decision-making in healthcare.

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves treatment outcomes, making accurate prediction models critically important.
